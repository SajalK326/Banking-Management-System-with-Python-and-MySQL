# Banking-Management-System-with-Python-and-MySQL
This repository is made by <b>Sajal Kapoor</b>.
<br>
It contains my Project on <b>Banking Management System</b> that is created using <b>Python</b>. The GUI is made using <i><b>tkinter library</b></i> of Python.
I have also used <b>MySQL</b> as Backend for Database Management of all the Customers.
<br><br>
There are two Python files, the first one <b>(SQL_Create_Database)</b> is for Connecting Python to MySQL, Initialize a Database and Create a Table for storing Customer Details.
The other one <b>(IPS-Bank_Management_System)</b> is the main file, which contains the code for the main program.
